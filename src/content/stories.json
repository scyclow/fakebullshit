    "content": "It's not secret that social networks the likes of facebook and twitter are falling out of style. Young people these days are waking up to the shocking fact that giant multinational technology corporations don't have your best interest at heart. The fact of the matter is that these companies treat their users dirt. They build websites and apps that are merely glorified dopamine slot machines, designed to addict people of all stripes to using their service. And then, they turn around to sell all the demographic, psychographic, and biometric data that they can get their hands on. In fact, there are even VERY CREDIBLE reports that some of these social networks are engaging in various mind control techniques without any consent whatsoever! \n If you're feeling pessamistic about the future of your on-line browsing habits, then I don't blame you. \n But there is some good news: People are WAKING UP to all of this nefarious behavior and seeking out alternative social media outlets. \n One of the most popular alternatives is <a href=\"https://friendworld.social\">FriendWorld.social</a>. In fact, people seem to be migrating to friendworld in droves! The week-over-week growth of the userbase is truly staggering, and has been SKYROCKETING as of late! \n So what makes friendworld so popular? For starters, the creators have commited themselves to an uncompromising degree of high-quality content. And it shows! Clicking on any thread at random is almost guaranteed to be thought-provoking, insightful, and (at times) cleverly laugh-out-loud funny! And while they do need to show a limited number of ads to keep their servers running, they at least have the good grace to avoid the same microtargetting techniques employed by more established players. Moreover, they appear to have partnered with a hand-selected third-party ad agency to ensure that all advertisements are as accurate and tasteful as possible \n In all, friendworld is a delightful corner of the internet, that shows everything that the web can be. It can be a place to think, a place to laugh, or a place to unwind. And most importantly, it can be a place to connect and meet a new friend :)",

The NY Times called Trump, and I quote, an \"Un-hinged psychopath\" (https://youtu.be/3LNvXjb44-U?t=1m16s) who is a \"mentally unstable MANIAC\" (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/opinion/is-it-time-to-call-trump-mentally-ill.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-right-region&region=opinion-c-col-right-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region).

The press has become so dishonest that we aren't even talking about it. Their level of dishonesty is COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL. All the President wants to do is protect our country, and it's becoming increasingly difficult for him to accomplish that when the Media continuously reports on unsubstantiated facts, which are clearly meant to harm the President and prevent him from protecting our country from radical terrorists who want to KILL us for our American beliefs and way of life -- and this is very difficult to do when the HIGHLY CLASSIFIED information is leaked, and so-called news organizations are broadcasting state secrets directly to terrorist leaders, whick makes in very very easy for them to plan accordingly! \n They just don't get it. All of these articles are reporting lies. It's been showed time and time again that these stories are fake fake news, and they report it anyhow. So why jeoperdize national security for the sake of reporting falsehoods?? \n When it comes right down to it, the media should be ashamed of themselves for reporting such blatent falsehoods.
